00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,814
I'm gonna go get booze.

00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:22,152
Great!

give me a little more.

I liked it.
I may join you later.

Oh! You must love cooking
in this kitchen!

No, not really.
Sean does.

186
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:09,663
I think it's probably just
an excuse to avoid writing.

187
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,264
Your husband's a writer?

188
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,299
No. He wrote a book
10 years ago.

189
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:14,634
It made him the toast
of the town.

190
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:15,836
I actually had to stalk him

to make him
fall in love with me.

192
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:20,440
But then, nothing. He never
wrote anything ever again.

193
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:22,942
- It's the old bait-and-switch.
- What was the book?

194
00:09:22,944 --> 00:09:25,245
It's called
<i>Darkness at Dawn.</i>

195

that in my book club!

- Really?
- This was... Yeah.

197
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:30,783
Well, this was back when
I first became a single mom,

198
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:33,253
and I joined this book club, and
that was the first book we read.

199
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:35,188
It's so impressive.

200
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,225

But that one...

211
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:09,255
That one did.
That was brutal.

212
00:10:09,257 --> 00:10:10,957
I don't talk
about it a lot.

213
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,292

I just met.

Baby, if you
apologize again,

216

I'm gonna have to slap
the sorry out of you.

Yeah. That's...
I'm not sorry.

218

That's a hard habit
to break, though.

dating anyone?

No. Slim pickings
in Warfield.

00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:30,244
Well, you are an hour
and a half outside the city.

223
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:33,513
I'm not gonna date someone from the city.
(CHUCKLES)

224
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:35,414
I tried eHarmony
for a while,

225
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,682
and then that mother
of three wound up

226
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:37,884
with her head
in the trash can,

227
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:39,686
you remember that?
And I... Ugh.

228
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:41,654
I said, "No thank you.
Delete."

- you're too sexy to give up.

I don't know. Um...

If your head's gonna
end up in a trash can,

234
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,366
your head's gonna end up
in a trash can.

235
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:55,936
I just didn't think I would
end up a single mom,

236
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:57,703
struggling to make
ends meet.

237
00:10:57,705 --> 00:10:59,438
I mean, my husband
had life insurance,

238
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,974
thank goodness,
but not a lot.

239
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:02,609
I put half of that away
for Miles' college,

240
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:05,578
and so, with
that coming in,

241
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,347
the money still
runs out in 2020.

242
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:09,850
Thank God
for his life insurance.

243
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:10,917
Yeah.

244
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,951
My husband
doesn't have anything

245
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:14,053
if it makes you feel better.
But he does spend like

246
00:11:14,055 --> 00:11:15,755
- he's the man of the hour.

We can't even
sell this house.

249
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:21,294
We bought it
during the bubble.

250
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:22,962
I love your house.

251
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:24,965
Don't dream of selling it.

252
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:29,239
If I were you, I'd just bask
in this kitchen all day long!

253
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:33,407
- Then you should move in.

to being house poor.

It's just another one
of my bad decisions.

00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,753
Yeah. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
It's great.

260
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:47,988
Is that a charity symbol?

261
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,325
Yeah, Mother Teresa and I are,
like, the same person, so...

262
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:53,659
It's a nice contrast
with your ring.

263
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:55,995
Thanks. Yeah, this is
a family heirloom.

264
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:57,596
It belonged to Sean's
great-grandmom,

265
00:11:57,598 --> 00:11:58,597
and then his mom,

266
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,567
and she insisted that I
have it, so, you know?

is blocking the garage?

- Mmm...

00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:09,076
Your wife is trying to get me
to stop apologizing.

271
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:12,546
Or maybe you can
get her to start.

I'm sure
it's 5:00 somewhere.

276
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:20,787
Oh, my God,
did you just come up

277
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:21,955
with that cliche
by yourself?

278
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:23,456
He's such
a brilliant writer.

279
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,692
I have to say,
you inspire me.

Not enough, apparently.

thank you very much

"for going to the grocery
store," he said,

283
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:32,832
dripping with sarcasm.

284
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,533

you'd want a break

- from not writing ever.

she won the joust.

- Hi, Stephanie.

with our kid.

290
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:47,350
She read your book.

291
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:49,982
I did. I loved it!

292
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:51,618
It reminded me
of William Thackeray.

293
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,818
She really read it.

294
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,553
Wow, not many people

295
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:55,922
trot out Thackeray
as a reference.

296
00:12:55,924 --> 00:12:58,057
Oh, I was an English
major at Barnard.

run off to London?

685
00:27:25,993 --> 00:27:27,626
Are you saying that
I broke my mother's hip?

686
00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:29,630
You leave town,
your wife takes off.

687
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,464
Maybe there's, um,

688
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:34,967
a close friend she might be
spending some time with.

689
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:36,902
Excuse me,
that's very rude.

690
00:27:36,904 --> 00:27:38,938
He is a dedicated
husband and father.

691
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,806
I have seen him with his
wife, let me tell you,

692
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:43,041
they've got more chemistry
than a science fair.

693
00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:44,176
Just exploring
all avenues, ma'am.

694
00:27:44,178 --> 00:27:46,781
Well, that avenue is a dead
end, so you can drop it.

695
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,848
And where's
Emily's family?

696
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,483
She doesn't have any.

697
00:27:51,485 --> 00:27:52,585
She was an only child,

698
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,424
and her mother and father died
when she was a teenager.

699
00:27:56,456 --> 00:27:58,024
I'm sorry,
I didn't know that.

700
00:27:58,026 --> 00:27:59,557
OFFICER: We'll file
a missing person's report

701
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:02,327
and contact you
in the next couple of days.

702
00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:03,729
If she doesn't turn up,

703
00:28:03,731 --> 00:28:06,031
we'll contact the local
authorities in Miami.

704
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:08,467
Not planning any more trips,
are you, Mr. Townsend?

705
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:09,535
SEAN: No.

706
00:28:09,537 --> 00:28:11,569
I'm gonna be right here.

707
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:13,908
I'm gonna be at my house
with my son.

708
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,545
We can show ourselves out.

709
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:21,346
SEAN: <i>God knows we've had
our troubles in the past,</i>

710
00:28:21,348 --> 00:28:24,317
but I don't think she'd just
up and leave her child.

711
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,553
No, God, she adores Nicky.
She wouldn't do that.

712
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:29,521
She is an enigma, my wife.

713
00:28:29,523 --> 00:28:30,990
That's what drew me to her.

714
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:32,557
It can also
make her impossible.

715
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,492
She can be
so fiercely private.

716
00:28:34,494 --> 00:28:35,461
She sure doesn't like

717
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,595
having her picture taken,
I'll tell you that.

718
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:38,830
I remember this one time,
she shut down my Facebook

719
00:28:38,832 --> 00:28:40,999
because I posted up
a family picture.

720
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:43,001
Ugh. Social media
is so tricky.

721
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:44,336
I can get
to close to her,

722
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:45,971
I can never quite reach her.

723
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:48,708
She's like
a beautiful ghost.

724
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,542
Never entirely there.

725
00:28:50,544 --> 00:28:51,977
That's so poetic.

726
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:54,012
That's why you're
such a good writer.

727
00:28:54,014 --> 00:28:56,615
I'm not a writer
anymore, Stephanie.

728
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:58,517
I gave all that up
just to chase this woman

729
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,521
for the rest of my life.

730

(SEAN SCOFFS)

731
00:29:01,723 --> 00:29:03,788
I should order a taxi
and go home.

732
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,458
Yeah.

733
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,930
Oh, gosh, it's 1:25, they
stop driving at 1:00 here.

734
00:29:11,098 --> 00:29:12,932
That couch pulls out, um,

735
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:14,700
if you wanna stay over.

736
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:16,535
I know Nicky would love it

737
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:18,604
if you were here
in the morning.

738
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:19,775
That would be lovely.

739
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,911
(BLENDER WHIRRING)

740
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:38,691
SEAN: Who wants
more B vitamins?

741
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,858
- MILES: Yeah!
- NICKY: I do!

742
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,660
SEAN: Yeah?
Are they nice?

743
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:43,695
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Delicious?

744
00:29:43,697 --> 00:29:46,132
- Hi.
- SEAN: Hey.

745
00:29:46,134 --> 00:29:47,566
Uh, what on Earth
are you making?

746
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:49,835
These are
hangover smoothies.

747
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,604
They get it
right out of you.

748
00:29:51,606 --> 00:29:53,838
And the kids love them.

749
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,441
Little tip,
they have a full portion

750
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:56,575
of vegetables in them,

751
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:57,576
and they don't even
know it.

752
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:59,612
It's so hard to get kids
to eat their vegetables.

753
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:00,615
SEAN: Right?

754
00:30:01,749 --> 00:30:03,449
Mmm.

755
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:04,720
Wanna try some?

756
00:30:05,086 --> 00:30:06,421
Great.

757
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,694
Good?

758
00:30:15,061 --> 00:30:16,060
(CHUCKLES)

759
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:19,698
I think we should get ready
for school. (GROANS)

760

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,205

for a hangover smoothie.</i>

<i>Uh, it's really nice.</i>

00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:30,175
<i>I especially
want to thank everybody</i>

766

<i>who's written in
to ask about Emily.</i>

767
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,416
<i>It's been four days now.</i>

768
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:37,349
<i>So...</i>

769
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:40,486
<i>The good news is that Sean
is home from London,</i>

770

<i>and he's working very
closely with the police.</i>

771

<i>Um, actually, moms,</i>

772
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:49,494
<i>I know a lot of you
are hung up on the idea</i>

773
00:30:49,496 --> 00:30:51,564
<i>that the husband
is always the primary suspect.</i>

774
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:53,434
<i>I know, I've seen</i>
Law and Order.

775
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:55,099
<i>But, um...</i>

776
00:30:55,101 --> 00:30:57,635
<i>First, I'm here to tell you</i>

777
00:30:57,637 --> 00:31:00,538
<i>Sean was in London
when Emily disappeared.</i>

778
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,540
<i>And some of you
have suggested</i>

779
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:05,176
<i>that he did that
to set up an alibi,</i>

780
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:09,815
<i>but he's an amazing husband
and an amazing father, so...</i>

781
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:11,416
<i>The police
haven't been much help.</i>

782
00:31:11,418 --> 00:31:13,618
<i>But every mom knows that if you
want something done right,</i>

783
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,753
<i>you have to do it yourself.</i>

784
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:17,522
<i>I will leave
no stone unturned.</i>

785
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:19,224

what Emily would want.</i>

788
00:31:24,831 --> 00:31:25,897
Thanks for holding.

00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:27,732
How may I direct your call?

790
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:28,834
Hi, my name

791
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:30,502
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

792
00:31:30,504 --> 00:31:32,203
My friend works here.
She's been missing...

793
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:34,173
Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?

794
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:36,107
I tried to call
her assistant.

795
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:38,277
- Dennis Nylon, please hold.
- Valerie.

796
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,345
She wasn't super helpful.

797
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:40,913
Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?

798
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:42,114
I can't tell
if you're talking to me.

799
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:43,518
You're looking right at me.

800
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:45,617
- Dennis Nylon, please hold.
- Okay.

801
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:47,619
Thanks for holding.
How may I direct your call?

802
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:48,953
Her name is Emily Nelson.

803
00:31:48,955 --> 00:31:50,689
She's the head
of the PR department.

804
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:52,024
Emily's not in today.

805
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:53,692
I know she's not in.

806
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:55,961
- Dennis Nylon, please hold.
- Okay.

807
00:31:55,963 --> 00:31:57,829
Just gonna...

808
00:31:57,831 --> 00:32:00,298
Sorry. No, I am not sorry.

809
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,002
I need to speak
to Dennis Nylon, please?

810
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:05,671
A woman's missing, so...

811
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,772
Mr. Nylon's
not here right now.

812
00:32:07,774 --> 00:32:08,907
Great, I'll wait.

813
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:10,077
Knock yourself out.

814
00:32:10,978 --> 00:32:12,113
Okay.

815
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:31,063
RECEPTIONIST:
Dennis Nylon, please hold.

816
00:32:31,065 --> 00:32:32,330
Um, Mr. Nylon?

817
00:32:32,332 --> 00:32:34,199
We don't accept
unsolicited resumes.

818
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:35,733
Cool, that's not why
I'm here.

819
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:36,835
Um, we have a problem.

820
00:32:36,837 --> 00:32:38,636
We most certainly do.

821
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:39,971
A friend of mine works in
your publicity department...

822
00:32:39,973 --> 00:32:41,542
Is that a vintage
Hermes scarf?

823
00:32:42,242 --> 00:32:43,709
My Aunt Frieda
gave it to me.

824
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,176
Did she want you
to hang yourself with it?

825
00:32:45,178 --> 00:32:46,778
Look at that knot,
Jesus fucking Christ!

826
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,681
I'm here about
Emily Nelson.

827
00:32:48,683 --> 00:32:50,348
What about Emily?
What happened?

828
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,684
She asked me to pick up
her son four days ago

829
00:32:52,686 --> 00:32:54,019
because she went to Miami.

830
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:55,854
She's still not back.
No texts, no calls,

831
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:57,122
and no one in your office
seems to give a crap.

832
00:32:57,124 --> 00:32:58,126
Excuse my language.

833
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:01,226
- Kiko.
- Hmm?

834
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:02,928
Why did Emily
go to Miami?

835
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,299
I didn't know she did.

836
00:33:06,232 --> 00:33:08,232
We in this office
have learned that

837
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:09,934
when Emily elects
not to tell us something,

838
00:33:09,936 --> 00:33:11,336
it's best not to ask.

839
00:33:11,338 --> 00:33:12,805
Doesn't she work for you?

840
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:15,106
Emily's job
is to stop the apocalypse

841
00:33:15,108 --> 00:33:16,976
without worrying
any of the designers.

842
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:18,309
And she always
finds a way

843
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:19,845
to look fabulous
when she does it.

844
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:21,145
That's great!

845
00:33:21,147 --> 00:33:23,382
What do you suggest
that I do?

846
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:25,817
Never wear a vintage Hermes
scarf with a Gap T-shirt.

847
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:27,987
If you were truly Emily's
friend, you would know that.

848
00:33:27,989 --> 00:33:30,058
Excuse me,
I have a very busy day.

849
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:33,692
Valerie, my office.

850
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:34,695
Now!

851
00:33:49,844 --> 00:33:51,809
Hi.

852
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:53,848
DENNIS: Sit, sit, sit!
Emily! I want answers.

853
00:33:54,882 --> 00:33:57,218
MAN: Steven,
you forgot the shirts.

854
00:34:07,928 --> 00:34:10,294
WOMAN: No, I can't
help you with that.

855
00:34:10,296 --> 00:34:11,729
Of course he's
freaking out.

856
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:14,133
He needs someone
to manage this now.

857
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,303

00:51:19,292 --> 00:51:21,859
that he took out
an extra $4 million

1202
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:23,194
life insurance policy

1203
00:51:23,196 --> 00:51:24,964
on Emily
before she disappeared?

1204
00:51:26,999 --> 00:51:30,136
I was not aware of that, no.

1205
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,306
Why? How would I?

1206
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,808
(CHUCKLES) Okay, all right.

1207
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,113
(SIGHS) Yeah, I don't...

1208
00:51:39,778 --> 00:51:41,848
I'm sorry. What...

1209
00:51:43,816 --> 00:51:44,881
What are you...

1210
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:46,216
Are you saying
he had her rubbed out?

1211
00:51:46,218 --> 00:51:47,718
He hired a hitman?

1212
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,921
(LAUGHING)

1213
00:51:50,923 --> 00:51:53,256
I didn't say anything
about him hiring a hitman.

1214
00:51:53,258 --> 00:51:54,357
You just did.

1215
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:56,160
Okay.

1216
00:51:56,162 --> 00:51:57,794
I can see that
you're enjoying yourself,

1217
00:51:57,796 --> 00:51:58,930
Detective Summerville.

1218
00:51:58,932 --> 00:52:00,464
But if you wanna
grill someone, you should

1219
00:52:00,466 --> 00:52:03,000
really speak to Emily's
boss, Dennis Nylon.

1220
00:52:03,002 --> 00:52:04,801
He could not be
more suspicious.

1221
00:52:04,803 --> 00:52:07,071
That's super interesting
because he contacted us.

1222
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:10,174
And he said he thought you knew
more than you were letting on.

1223
00:52:10,176 --> 00:52:12,509
Well, he sucks.

1224
00:52:12,511 --> 00:52:15,011
So... (SIGHS)

1225
00:52:15,013 --> 00:52:17,314
As long as you're honest
with me, Ms. Smothers,

1226
00:52:17,316 --> 00:52:18,482
I swear to you,

1227
00:52:18,484 --> 00:52:20,417
you have nothing
to worry about. Okay?

1228
00:52:20,419 --> 00:52:24,187
I'm just following
breadcrumbs wherever they lead.

1229
00:52:24,189 --> 00:52:25,923
Okay, you know what?
I'm done for now.

1230
00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:27,959
Thanks for your time.

1231
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:30,528
(STAMMERS) Your theory doesn't
hold water, you know,

1232
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:31,928
because it doesn't explain

1233
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:34,232
the fake plane ticket
or the rental car.

1234
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,433
And why would someone
shoot her full of heroin

1235
00:52:36,435 --> 00:52:37,701
at a summer camp in Michigan?

1236
00:52:37,703 --> 00:52:39,772
There's plenty of good heroin
right here in Connecticut!

1237
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,805
I'm told.

1238
00:52:41,807 --> 00:52:44,408
Great, good. Okay, so
we have a lot to talk about.

1239
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:46,076
All right, then.
Enjoy the new house.

1240
00:52:46,078 --> 00:52:48,779
The worst breadcrumbs I've
ever heard of, you know.

1241
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:49,946
Couldn't fill
a Caesar salad

1242
00:52:49,948 --> 00:52:51,251
- with those breadcrumbs!
- (DOOR CLOSES)

1243
00:52:58,057 --> 00:52:59,392
(SIGHING IN RELIEF)

1244
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:48,004
Why is this Caesarean
salad so crunchy?

1245
00:53:48,006 --> 00:53:50,778
It's Caesar salad, baby,
and it's delicious.

1246
00:53:51,276 --> 00:53:52,412
What's in it?

1247
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:54,914
Breadcrumbs.

1248
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,247
Oh.

1249
00:53:56,249 --> 00:53:57,451
How was your day at work?

1250
00:53:58,417 --> 00:53:59,484
Grim.

1251
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,651
Spent most of the day
explaining the difference

1252
00:54:00,653 --> 00:54:05,122
between "your" possessive
and "you're" apostrophe R-E

1253
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:08,024
to college juniors.

1254
00:54:08,026 --> 00:54:09,996
I can see how that might
drive a man over the edge.

1255
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,629
I know, right?

1256
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:14,064
What about you boys?

1257
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:16,267
What'd you guys get up to
today at school?

1258
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:17,471
I saw my mom.

1259
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,140
I understand, Nicky,
that sometimes

1260
00:54:23,142 --> 00:54:25,078
we think we see people
that we miss

1261
00:54:26,011 --> 00:54:27,377
even if they're gone.

1262
00:54:27,379 --> 00:54:29,013
No, I saw her.

1263
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,214
She was right outside
the fence

1264
00:54:30,216 --> 00:54:32,051
by the kickball yard
at recess.

1265
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:36,087
Lots of people
look like someone else.

1266
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:37,357
Nobody looks like Mom!

1267
00:54:38,892 --> 00:54:40,160
She told me
to say hi to Stephanie.

1268
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,658
Nicky,

1269
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,261
this is unhealthy.

1270
00:54:43,263 --> 00:54:45,265
Miles saw her, too.
Right, Miles?

1271
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:48,098
I think I did.

1272
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,232
But I don't know.

1273
00:54:49,234 --> 00:54:50,634
I was playing tetherball.

1274
00:54:50,636 --> 00:54:52,470
Did you two hatch this up?

1275
00:54:52,472 --> 00:54:54,671
Is this a game, like when you
smash everything with trucks?

1276
00:54:54,673 --> 00:54:56,274
Because you know
what we say about lying.

1277
00:54:56,276 --> 00:54:58,910
I'm not lying!
I saw her! Fuck you!

1278
00:54:58,912 --> 00:55:00,310
Hey, Nicky!

1279
00:55:00,312 --> 00:55:01,314
MILES: Oopsy!

1280
00:55:03,283 --> 00:55:04,918
I'm sorry.

1281
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:16,160
Don't I get a kiss
good night?

1282
00:55:16,162 --> 00:55:18,095
Of course you do, sweetie.

1283
00:55:18,097 --> 00:55:20,031
Actually, you owe
the oopsy jar a quarter

1284
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:21,468
for earlier, but I...

1285
00:55:28,274 --> 00:55:29,276
Good night, sweetie.

1286
00:55:38,718 --> 00:55:39,920
Hey.

1287
00:55:41,153 --> 00:55:42,889
We should get naked.

1288
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:46,359
What is it?

1289
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,491
What's wrong?

1290
00:55:48,493 --> 00:55:52,029
I smell her, Sean.
I smell her perfume.

1291
00:55:52,031 --> 00:55:54,365
It's all over Nicky
like a ghost.

1292
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,732
He probably got
to her perfume bottle

1293
00:55:55,734 --> 00:55:57,435
in the medicine cabinet.

1294
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,270
He misses her.

1295
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,571
Okay? It's just you
being paranoid.

1296
00:56:00,573 --> 00:56:02,643
Is it? Because
I found this, too.

1297
00:56:04,176 --> 00:56:05,609
What's this?

1298
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:07,111
It's the friendship
bracelet I made her.

1299
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,682
I'm afraid to say
she would not have kept this.

1300
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:12,116
She hated stuff like this.

1301
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,283
She probably
gave it to him

1302
00:56:13,285 --> 00:56:14,718
right after
you gave it to her.

1303
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,720
Unless he's
telling the truth.

1304
00:56:16,722 --> 00:56:19,158
You saw her
with your own eyes.

1305
00:56:19,758 --> 00:56:21,292
In her coffin.

1306
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,692
There was something off.

1307
00:56:22,694 --> 00:56:24,761
They found her
at the bottom of a lake!

1308
00:56:24,763 --> 00:56:26,296
You saw her tattoo,

1309
00:56:26,298 --> 00:56:28,501
and you saw that ring
that she stole from my mother.

1310
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,703
She said your mother wanted
her to have that ring.

1311
00:56:32,705 --> 00:56:34,138
She said your
mother insisted.

1312
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,506
That's what she told you?
(SCOFFS)

1313
00:56:36,508 --> 00:56:38,676
My father gave that ring
to my mother.

1314
00:56:38,678 --> 00:56:40,044
It was like
the only bit of jewelry

1315
00:56:40,046 --> 00:56:41,312
that she ever owned.

1316
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:43,247
I took Emily to London
to meet my mother

1317
00:56:43,249 --> 00:56:44,482
after we eloped.

1318
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,151
It went missing
that weekend.

1319
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,220
My mother was frantic.
We searched everywhere.

1320
00:56:50,222 --> 00:56:51,657
Nothing. We didn't
find a single thing.

1321
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:55,058
<i>My mother was devastated.</i>

1322
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,530
<i>So we took a flight
back to New York.</i>

1323
00:56:57,763 --> 00:56:59,265
Guess what I found.

1324
00:57:00,098 --> 00:57:01,501
What did you find?

1325
00:57:02,435 --> 00:57:03,734
- No!
- (LAUGHS)

1326
00:57:03,736 --> 00:57:05,468
No way!

1327
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:08,071
- My little Sherlock Holmes.
- (LAUGHS)

1328
00:57:08,073 --> 00:57:09,807
Mum is gonna be
so relieved.

1329
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:11,709
Oh, come on, baby.

1330
00:57:11,711 --> 00:57:14,448
Mum will take it to the grave.
What a waste.

1331
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:16,446
So pretty.

1332
00:57:16,448 --> 00:57:17,415
Excuse me.

1333
00:57:17,417 --> 00:57:20,250
Not amusing, my darling,
not in the slightest.

1334
00:57:20,252 --> 00:57:23,053
I'm not joking
in the slightest,

1335
00:57:23,055 --> 00:57:24,821
(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
my darling.

1336
00:57:24,823 --> 00:57:25,823
(IN NORMAL ACCENT)
I took it.

1337
00:57:25,825 --> 00:57:28,191
I don't have any intention
of giving it back.

1338
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:29,392
Of course
we're gonna give it back.

1339
00:57:29,394 --> 00:57:31,095
No.

1340
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:32,430
We'll tell her that
it just slipped

1341
00:57:32,432 --> 00:57:33,696
into your purse
by accident,

1342
00:57:33,698 --> 00:57:36,232
and we've only
found it now.

1343
00:57:36,234 --> 00:57:38,169
But if you tell her
that I found it,

1344
00:57:38,171 --> 00:57:39,669
then I have to tell her
that I stole it.

1345
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:42,073
And what do you think
will be worse for her?

1346
00:57:42,075 --> 00:57:44,241
Thinking that
she lost her ring,

1347
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:47,078
or thinking that her son
married a thief? (GASPS)

1348
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,578
- Baby...
- Hey.

1349
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,716
You choose, her or me?

1350
00:57:53,852 --> 00:57:55,752
Meet me in the bathroom
in 20 seconds.

1351
00:57:55,754 --> 00:57:56,789
Knock twice.

1352
00:58:23,448 --> 00:58:26,816
SEAN: <i>Nine months later,
Nicky was born.</i>

1353
00:58:26,818 --> 00:58:28,886
STEPHANIE:
<i>How could you stay with her?</i>

1354
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:31,154
I was spellbound.

1355
00:58:31,156 --> 00:58:32,256
She was the only woman

1356
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,691
I could never
figure out fully.

1357
00:58:33,693 --> 00:58:35,825
As a young, arrogant
writer, I could never

1358
00:58:35,827 --> 00:58:37,861
live up to what
she expected of me.

1359
00:58:37,863 --> 00:58:39,662
I was always
looking over my shoulder.

1360
00:58:39,664 --> 00:58:41,100
I could hardly sleep.

1361
00:58:42,502 --> 00:58:44,334
But with you,
it's different.

1362
00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:45,769
I sleep like a log.

1363
00:58:45,771 --> 00:58:47,504
That's what every woman
wants to hear.

1364
00:58:47,506 --> 00:58:48,571
You know what I mean.

1365
00:58:48,573 --> 00:58:50,342
You understand me,
you see me.

1366
00:58:51,243 --> 00:58:53,209
You've rebuilt me,
Stephanie.

1367
00:58:53,211 --> 00:58:54,647
I've even started
writing again.

1368
00:58:55,481 --> 00:58:57,480
First couple of chapters,

1369
00:58:57,482 --> 00:58:58,685
but it's a start.

1370
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:01,588
Oh.

1371
00:59:02,888 --> 00:59:04,654
That's wonderful.

1372
00:59:04,656 --> 00:59:06,557
You took a broken man,

1373
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,892
and you pieced him
back together again.

1374
00:59:08,894 --> 00:59:11,363
You're unlike any other

What were you saying about
me being a fucking psycho?

01:24:39,257 --> 01:24:40,822
Do you love her?

1893
01:24:40,824 --> 01:24:42,992
No. It was just sex.

1894
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:45,764
Did you think of me
when you were fucking her?

1895
01:24:46,029 --> 01:24:47,031
Yes.

1896
01:24:49,867 --> 01:24:51,466
Do you love me
or not, baby?

1897
01:24:51,468 --> 01:24:53,169
Of course I do.

1898
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,937
She doesn't mean
a thing to me.

1899
01:24:54,939 --> 01:24:56,171

Can you imagine
if I would've, though?

01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:06,247
What a mess.

1906

Emily, you're crazy.

1907
01:25:08,086 --> 01:25:10,419
Hey, it's pretty
simple. You know?

1908
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:12,324
It's your choice.
Her or me?

1909
01:25:13,190 --> 01:25:14,392
It's not that hard.

1910
01:25:16,327 --> 01:25:17,329
Hey.

1911
01:25:17,895 --> 01:25:19,228
Stop it.

01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:21,362
You love this.

1918

I'm investigating

for your late wife.

1920
01:25:51,796 --> 01:25:52,798
Sean,

1921
01:25:53,998 --> 01:25:55,901
did you know that
Emily had a twin?

1922
01:25:58,535 --> 01:26:00,068
No, but...

1923
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:01,871
Well, I hate
to even say this,

1924
01:26:01,873 --> 01:26:03,339
but it means
the body in the lake

1925
01:26:03,341 --> 01:26:05,273
could be this sister.

1926
01:26:05,275 --> 01:26:06,975
ISABEL: It could explain
the DNA match.

1927
01:26:06,977 --> 01:26:08,077
And if that's the case,

1928
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,315
then where is Emily?

1929
01:26:14,918 --> 01:26:17,553
If my wife was still alive,
she'd come home.

1930
01:26:17,555 --> 01:26:18,757
She'd wanna see her son.

1931

I'm not a cop,

isn't it?

01:26:32,169 --> 01:26:34,002
- Yeah.
- ISABEL: I will say,

1937
01:26:34,004 --> 01:26:35,403
it's unusual

to live with someone
as husband and wife

1939
01:26:37,208 --> 01:26:38,474
and not know
that they have a twin.

1940
01:26:38,476 --> 01:26:40,442
She was a very
private person.

1941

with a payment of this size,

1945
01:26:48,886 --> 01:26:50,952
we'll have to continue

01:26:50,954 --> 01:26:52,054
Of course.

1947
01:26:52,056 --> 01:26:54,156

give all our findings

to the authorities.

1949
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:57,126
Of course,
anything you need.

1950
01:26:57,128 --> 01:26:59,260
I just hope that my wife
is still alive.

1951

do hear from her...

- Thank you so much!

- Thanks.

she had a twin.

Did I?

1960
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:21,317
Why didn't you?

1961
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,585
You knew
and you didn't tell me.

Take a Xanax.

1965
01:27:29,392 --> 01:27:31,292

1982
01:28:15,038 --> 01:28:17,074
Ooh, wisdom.

1983
01:28:18,409 --> 01:28:20,341
Hey, give me that.

1984
01:28:20,343 --> 01:28:21,911
I don't know
what tricks you have

1985
01:28:21,913 --> 01:28:24,013
up those new
sleeves of yours.

1986
01:28:24,015 --> 01:28:25,648
You think
I poisoned both drinks?

1987
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:26,985
That's not my style.

1988
01:28:27,551 --> 01:28:29,254
I don't even eat gluten.

1989
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:33,992
- Want another?
- Please.

1990
01:28:35,493 --> 01:28:36,658
First, tell me why

1991
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,327
you killed your father
and sister.

1992
01:28:38,329 --> 01:28:39,929
Okay, why don't we
first talk about

1993
01:28:39,931 --> 01:28:41,296
your son's real father?

1994
01:28:41,298 --> 01:28:44,099
Oh! Emily,
I hold all the cards here.

1995
01:28:44,101 --> 01:28:45,567
I wanna know
about your twin, Faith.

1996
01:28:45,569 --> 01:28:46,702
I'm not a twin.

1997
01:28:46,704 --> 01:28:48,536
Great, I know that you are.

1998
01:28:48,538 --> 01:28:50,205
We were triplets.

1999
01:28:50,207 --> 01:28:52,474
Faith, Hope, and Charity.
Charity was stillborn.

2000
01:28:52,476 --> 01:28:53,575
Mom thought we offed her

2001
01:28:53,577 --> 01:28:54,643
- in the womb.
- Hmm.

2002
01:28:54,645 --> 01:28:56,577
Dad believed her.

2003
01:28:56,579 --> 01:28:58,482
She's quite a woman,
your mother.

2004
01:28:59,617 --> 01:29:01,250
I had a nice afternoon
with Mags.

2005
01:29:01,252 --> 01:29:03,117
You met my mother?

2006
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:05,219
She likes her martinis
even stronger than yours.

2007
01:29:05,221 --> 01:29:07,956
We had a little walk
down memory lane.

2008
01:29:07,958 --> 01:29:09,692
She's a cold woman, Em.

2009
01:29:09,694 --> 01:29:12,594
Bet you couldn't do
anything right in her eyes.

2010
01:29:12,596 --> 01:29:14,964
It was probably Faith's
idea to set the fire.

2011
01:29:14,966 --> 01:29:16,631
But then, all the bad ideas
were Faith's, weren't they?

2012
01:29:16,633 --> 01:29:18,666
- You don't know anything.
- Sure I do.

2013

(ECHOING) Fuck off!

2030
01:30:11,588 --> 01:30:14,255
We had to say goodbye,
so we did it with tattoos.

something for Charity.</i>

She was gonna head
south to Mexico,

2034
01:30:25,269 --> 01:30:27,236
<i>I was gonna go north.</i>

2035
01:30:27,238 --> 01:30:28,403
<i>We set a time
and place to meet</i>

2036
01:30:28,405 --> 01:30:30,207
<i>after the smoke cleared.</i>

2037
01:30:31,307 --> 01:30:33,809
<i>But then,
she never showed up.</i>

2038
01:30:33,811 --> 01:30:36,247
<i>I was worried sick.
I waited for days.</i>

2039
01:30:37,047 --> 01:30:38,546
<i>But nothing.</i>

2040
01:30:38,548 --> 01:30:40,115
I thought maybe
this is my opportunity

2041
01:30:40,117 --> 01:30:41,250
to do it on my own.

2042
01:30:41,252 --> 01:30:42,550
She was always getting me
into trouble.

2043
01:30:42,552 --> 01:30:43,719
So I bought a one-way
ticket to New York

2044
01:30:43,721 --> 01:30:45,120
and never looked back.

2045
01:30:45,122 --> 01:30:46,220
Did you miss her?

2046
01:30:46,222 --> 01:30:47,288
Of course I missed her.

2047
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:48,791
I wasn't whole without her.

2048
01:30:48,793 --> 01:30:50,692
But I couldn't go on like
that, I had to survive.

2049
01:30:50,694 --> 01:30:51,593
And it worked.

2050
01:30:51,595 --> 01:30:53,728
Yeah, my life in New York
fell into place.

2051
01:30:53,730 --> 01:30:56,564
I got a job,
worked my way up.

Oh, you know
that part, though.

2054
01:31:01,137 --> 01:31:02,571
Then your sister calls.

- You had to see her.
- Yeah, of course I did.

01:31:06,142 --> 01:31:09,344
So you fabricate
this trip to Miami,

2058
01:31:09,346 --> 01:31:10,645
meet up at the old camp.

01:46:38,775 --> 01:46:40,311
Thanks. That means a lot.

2402
01:46:41,343 --> 01:46:43,379
But you did
confess, Emily.

2403
01:46:44,146 --> 01:46:47,150
Oh. Yeah. Um...

2404
01:46:48,450 --> 01:46:51,786
I did. But I cut
these first, though.

2405
01:46:51,788 --> 01:46:54,054
For our
friendship bracelets.

2406
01:46:54,056 --> 01:46:55,756
One for you!

2407
01:46:55,758 --> 01:46:59,126
That is disappointing.

2408
01:46:59,128 --> 01:47:02,462
Oh! My God! Look what I found.

2410
01:47:03,565 --> 01:47:07,602
Okay. You can't shoot us.
The police are outside.

2411
01:47:07,604 --> 01:47:09,804
No, they're not.

2412
01:47:09,806 --> 01:47:12,139
(IMITATING) Hey,
cops, Stephanie here.

2413
01:47:12,141 --> 01:47:13,207
Change of plans.

2414
01:47:13,209 --> 01:47:15,443
I'm meeting Emily and Sean
at Darren's house now.

2415
01:47:15,445 --> 01:47:16,544
I'll see you there.

2416
01:47:16,546 --> 01:47:18,246
You sent them
to Darren's house?

2417
01:47:18,248 --> 01:47:20,447
- (BONG BUBBLING)
- It's a virus.

2418
01:47:20,449 --> 01:47:22,716
String theory.
String theory, isn't it?

2419
01:47:22,718 --> 01:47:25,685
- (WOMEN SCREAM)
- Hands up! Weapons down!

2420
01:47:25,687 --> 01:47:27,354
No, I have
a prescription for that.

2421
01:47:27,356 --> 01:47:29,090
I have ocular pressure!

2422
01:47:29,092 --> 01:47:30,558
Come on, I've been
on the run for 10 years.

2423
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,460
You think I don't know
how to manipulate the system?

2424
01:47:32,462 --> 01:47:34,429
So you're gonna kill us?

2425
01:47:34,431 --> 01:47:36,397
Well, what the fuck else
am I supposed to do?

2426
01:47:36,399 --> 01:47:38,066
You two will
clearly go to

2427
01:47:38,068 --> 01:47:39,700
extraordinary lengths
to take me down.

2428
01:47:39,702 --> 01:47:41,368
And you know too much.

2429
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:43,571
So, I feel like
a murder-suicide

2430
01:47:43,573 --> 01:47:46,206
is the only fitting
end for you two.

2431
01:47:46,208 --> 01:47:47,274
And if you kill him,

2432
01:47:47,276 --> 01:47:49,609
I think our insurance
still covers that, right?

2433
01:47:49,611 --> 01:47:51,411
I mean, sort of perfect.

2434
01:47:51,413 --> 01:47:53,214
One door closes
and another one opens.

2435
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:54,549
Thank you for that.

2436
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:56,651
You always have been fucking
crazy, haven't you?

2437
01:47:56,653 --> 01:47:58,187
Have I?

(SEAN GROANING)

2439
01:48:00,522 --> 01:48:02,322
Oh, shit. You're right.

2440
01:48:02,324 --> 01:48:04,193
God, you fucking...
You actually fucking shot me.

2441
01:48:05,128 --> 01:48:06,727
I'm gonna miss him.

2442
01:48:06,729 --> 01:48:07,731
Your turn.

2443
01:48:08,664 --> 01:48:10,764
Emily, come on.

2444
01:48:10,766 --> 01:48:12,532
You're not gonna kill me.

2445
01:48:12,534 --> 01:48:14,801
Oh, yeah. I killed my
dad and my sister,

2446
01:48:14,803 --> 01:48:18,505
but I could never kill my
husband-fucking best friend.

2447
01:48:18,507 --> 01:48:20,508
Am I really
your best friend?

2448
01:48:20,510 --> 01:48:22,676
You're not just saying
that for, you know...

2449
01:48:22,678 --> 01:48:24,478
No, no, I'm not
just saying that at all.

2450
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:26,413
I get worried
that it's just me.

2451
01:48:26,415 --> 01:48:28,182
I know, sometimes
I was worried about that, too.

2452
01:48:28,184 --> 01:48:29,517
- (STEPHANIE LAUGHS)
- (CONTINUES GROANING)

2453
01:48:29,519 --> 01:48:31,285
So hard to connect
with other moms.

2454
01:48:31,287 --> 01:48:33,353
And then when you have
a full-time job, it's...

2455
01:48:33,355 --> 01:48:34,889
Okay, okay,
don't pull that crap.

2456
01:48:34,891 --> 01:48:36,256
Being a mom
is a full-time job.

2457
01:48:36,258 --> 01:48:38,158
What I do is hard work.

2458
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:39,527
And I have my vlog
on top of that,

2459
01:48:39,529 --> 01:48:41,261
and that's just getting
bigger and bigger.

2460
01:48:41,263 --> 01:48:43,331
If you came on the vlog,
that'd be so fun.

2461
01:48:43,333 --> 01:48:44,733
If you came on the vlog

2462
01:48:44,735 --> 01:48:47,635
and confessed to killing your father
and sister and held me at gunpoint,

2463
01:48:47,637 --> 01:48:49,269
I could probably hit
a million subscribers.

2464
01:48:49,271 --> 01:48:50,837
Aww. That
would've been great.

2465

do that right now?

I'm sorry.

they got away with it.
